This is the alphabet we are mapping our hex code to. There are
32 symbols in the alphabet and 255 possible 2-digit hex values.
To map a character to a value, we simply take its 32-modulus and
append the number of its occurence in the modulus cycle, with 0
meaning "1st", 1 mean "2nd" and so on. For example: 

Given the hex digit 65:

	65 % 32 = 1
	floor( 65 / 32 ) = 2

	so the alphabet symbol for 65 is the symbol at index 1: 'PT'.
	65 is also the 3rd occurrence of a 32-modulus of 1 (with 1 
	being the first occurrence and 33 being the second of course.)
	so the code for this hex symbol is PT2

Here we decide if we should sleep, execute the program, or
convert it to serpent code. If the file is already a serpent
file, we convert the serpent code within it back to bytecode,
write the pyc file, call it as a subprocess and then tell this
module to sleep until the main program is complete. If the 
file is being converted we compile the source, then convert 
the bytecode to serpent code and draw the serpent code to the
new ss.py file with this module as the only imported module. 
When that ss.py file is compiled, this file will extract the 
code and run the pyc file. This is easier than obfuscating the
actual python code because we don't need to worry about 
whitespace when writing the pyc file.
